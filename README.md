## üìÅ Project Overview

Excel remains one of the most widely used tools in business environments for data analysis and reporting. This project emphasizes the modern Excel ecosystem‚Äôs capabilities to:

- Handle large and complex datasets efficiently.
- Build relational data models.
- Create interactive and insightful reports.
- Automate repetitive data preparation tasks.

Through this project, I have applied ETL principles, designed star schema data models, created dynamic Pivot Tables, and developed DAX measures ‚Äî all to deliver a clean, user-friendly, and business-oriented reporting solution.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Traditional Excel workbooks often rely on manual formulae and flat data structures, which can become inefficient and error-prone with growing data complexity.

The challenge was to learn and apply advanced Excel tools and best practices to overcome these limitations by:

- Streamlining data preparation and transformation.
- Establishing robust relationships between tables.
- Creating reusable and scalable calculation measures.
- Designing reports that are intuitive and visually effective for stakeholders.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Master ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes within Excel.
- Utilize Power Query to clean and automate data transformations.
- Implement Power Pivot to create a scalable data model.
- Design star schema relationships for efficient data analysis.
- Build dynamic Pivot Tables for interactive data summarization.
- Develop DAX formulas to centralize and streamline calculations.
- Create user-centric reports with conditional formatting and visual aids.
